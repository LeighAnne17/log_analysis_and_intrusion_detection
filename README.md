# 🔐 Log Analysis & Intrusion Detection
## 📌 Project Overview

Cyberattacks often start quietly with repeated login failures, suspicious IP addresses or abnormal access patterns hidden inside logs.

This project focuses on analyzing authentication logs to identify potential security threats, such as brute-force attacks and abnormal login behavior.
It demonstrates how Python and data analysis techniques can be used to support real-world cybersecurity monitoring and incident detection.

This project was built as part of my cybersecurity-focused data science portfolio, showcasing practical analysis skills rather than theory alone.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Objectives

• Analyze authentication logs for suspicious activity

• Identify users and IP addresses with abnormal failed login behavior

• Visualize login trends over time

• Apply basic anomaly detection techniques

• Present findings in a clear, professional, and security-focused manner

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧠 Key Cybersecurity Concepts Demonstrated

• Log analysis

• Brute-force attack detection

• Anomaly detection

• Security monitoring fundamentals

• Threat pattern identification

• Data-driven security insights

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

• Python

• Pandas & NumPy – data processing

• Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualization

• Google Colab – interactive analysis environment

• CSV Authentication Logs – simulated real-world dataset

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset simulates authentication logs commonly found in enterprise systems.

Key Fields:

• timestamp – login attempt time

•  username – user account attempting access

• ip_address – source IP of login attempt

• status – Success or Failed login

• location – country of origin

The dataset includes repeated failed login attempts to simulate potential attack behavior.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📊 Analysis Performed
✔ Exploratory Analysis

• Dataset structure and quality checks

• Success vs failed login distribution

✔ Security-Focused Insights

• Users with the highest number of failed logins

• IP addresses associated with repeated failures

• Login activity trends over time

✔ Anomaly Detection

• Statistical thresholding to flag users with unusually high failed login attempts

• Identification of accounts that may require security intervention

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚨 Key Findings

• Most users behave normally with minimal failed login attempts

• A small number of users and IPs show repeated failed access, which could indicate:

• Brute-force attempts

• Credential stuffing

• Unauthorized access attempts

• Login activity varies over time, reinforcing the importance of continuous monitoring

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔍 Why This Project Matters

Authentication logs are one of the first places security teams look when investigating incidents.

This project demonstrates:

• Practical cybersecurity thinking

• The ability to translate raw logs into actionable insights

•  Strong Python and data analysis skills applied to security use cases

It also reflects how data analytics and cybersecurity intersect in real-world environments.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

Machine learning–based intrusion detection

• IP reputation scoring

• Geo-location anomaly analysis

• Real-time monitoring dashboards

• Integration with SIEM-style pipelines
